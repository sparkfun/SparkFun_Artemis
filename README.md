[*SparkFun Artemis Module (WRL-15484)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15484)

The Artemis Module from SparkFun is the first product to bridge the market between hobbyists and consumer products. We've exhaustively packaged all the power of a modern microcontroller into a module that is both extremely easy to use but is mass-market ready. 

The flexibility of the Artemis module starts with our [Arduino core](https://github.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Apollo3). You can program and use the Artemis module just like you would an Uno or any other Arduino. Time to first blink is just 5 minutes away! We built the core from the ground up, making it fast and as light weight as possible. 

Next is the module itself. Measuring 10x15mm the Artemis module has all the support circuitry you need to use the fantastic Apollo3 processor in your next project. We're proud to say the SparkFun Artemis module is the first open source hardware module with the design files freely and easily available here (on this repo). We've carefully designed the module so that routing to the module can be done with low-cost 2-layer PCBs with 8mil trace/space. Addtionally, we've released four open-source-hardware example products that act as a starting point for your product.

Made in the USA at SparkFun's Boulder production line the Artemis module is designed for consumer grade products. This truly differentiates the Artemis from its Arduino brethren. Ready to scale your product? The Artemis will grow with you beyond the Uno footprint and Arduino IDE. Tape and reel quantities or the Artemis module are available in addition, the Artemis has an advanced HAL (hardware abstraction layer) allowing users to push the modern Cortex-M4F architecture to its limit. 

This repo contains the design files for the 4-layer PCB. This design is pretty reliant on sophisticated manufacturing tools. We *do not* recommend that you order PCBs and attempt to hand stencil or hand place these components. We hope you can learn from our work and share what you've learned for the next generation of engineers and hackers.
